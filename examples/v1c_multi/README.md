# V1c Multi

Uses `v1std.Multi` to implement multiple sizes and zoom levels of filters, as used in the LVis model. This configuration exactly replicates the LVis parameters, with Low and Medium resolution filters on a 16 degree parafoveal field-of-view (FOV), with one level of zoom (8 degrees in the center). Color difference-of-Gaussian filters provide color blob filtering.
