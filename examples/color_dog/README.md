# Color DoG

Implements V1 blob-like color difference-of-gaussian (DoG) filters that provide an efficient, physiologically-realistic representation of the color of surfaces, based on red-green and blue-yellow contrasting colors.

These are first-order color filters, that do not encode contrast edges -- they have the same sigma for On and Off filters.

* macbeth is a rendered standard color sample.

* granger rainbow is ROYGIV rainbow..
